# Polarity++
## What is it?
 Polarity++ is a C++ library combining Facial Emotional Recognition (FER), AFINN-165 (Also known as "Sentimood"), and RPPG Heart Rate monitoring to bring a more diverse responsiveness to AI-led text-based/narrative games!


> Note; *It can also be used in other game types to help create more responsive NPCs and reactive enemies!*


### TODO LIST:
- [x] Rewrite RPPGA code to be modular
- [x] Create Python Bindings
- [ ] Support Mobile?
- [ ] Create install instructions (wiki???)
- [ ] Rewrite code to automatically share the camera 
- [ ] Rewrite `main.cpp` so it allows for selection of what to use
