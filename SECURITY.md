# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, please report it to us as soon as possible by emailing us at [me@ashleyxir.tech](mailto:me@ashleyxir.tech) or [opening an issue/ticket](https://github.com/Ashthetik/Polarity-/issues/new). We take security seriously and will work quickly to address any reported vulnerabilities.

## Scope
Please only report security vulnerabilities in our project. We are not able to address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies at this very moment, but we will do our best to work with the relevant maintainers to resolve any issues.

## Response
Once we receive a report of a security vulnerability, we will acknowledge receipt of the report within 24 hours. We will then work to quickly investigate and confirm the vulnerability before taking action to address it. We will keep the reporter informed of our progress and notify them once the vulnerability has been resolved.

## Responsible Disclosure
We ask that security researchers follow responsible disclosure practices when reporting vulnerabilities to us. This includes providing us with a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly. We also ask that researchers do not exploit the vulnerability for any reason or disclose it to any third parties.

## Thank You
We appreciate the time and effort that security researchers put into finding and reporting vulnerabilities. Your contributions help us to keep our project secure and protect our users. Thank you for your support in making our project a safer place.
